# Auto-Voice-Channels
A Discord bot that automatically creates voice channels as they are needed.

## Installation

Requires:

* Python 3.5+
* Discord.py rewrite version (install with `pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py`)

It's recommended to first create a virtual environment before installing discord.py: `python3 -m virtualenv bot-env`

## Usage

This bot is still WIP, so documenting it now would be pointless. Just read through the code to see what commands can be used.
